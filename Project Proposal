Create a private secure communications software application that runs on multiplatforms, PC Windows, iOS, Android, Mac.
Possible App name: "Mozweli Meets"
Safe and secure.
Must keep a record of attendees, for audit purposes.
Be able to launch presentations, video clips.
should be able to save Meeting links to invitees calendars.
The app must cater for 250 or more attendees that logs into the call from all parts of the world, across countries and time zones.
a feature to auto mute and turn camera off by the meeting organizer.
Every user profile must display a valid full name and the attendees profile photo, important for audits.
Main feature web conferencing and instant mesaging.
group video conferencing with screen sharing(perhaps linked to a secure Mozweli server).
We should also investigate Jitsi Meets, as its completely open source, and fully encrypted.
data security is very important, how can we build data protection technologies into the app to prevent any compromise from terrorists or cyber attacks.
Nuclear industry is highly regulated, so must keep that in mind, and has all meta data saved to MDM(Master Data Management) which is lead by Renier Smal.
